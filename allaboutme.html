        <h3>So this is the page about me so if you want to leave, go</h3>
        <p>
          So my name is Ava Levine, I am an incoming junior at Curtis High School.
           I am a part of the International Baccalaurete (IB) program as well as an active member of clubs at school. Out of school, I like to hang out with friends, shop and dance.
           I live in New York with my parents, my sister and my two cats.

        <h3> This is Probably Not What You Want to Hear</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout my time here on planet Earth, I have had the privilige to travel to different countries with my family and friends.
          Through traveling, I am able to appreciate the culture of other countries, making me a more rounded person.
