      <h3>The History Behind my Travels</h3>
      <p> My family and I have traveled a lot within the past few years. This year however, was the first year I went without them. This year, I went on foreign exchange with my school to the Netherlands.

      <button id="myButton" onclick="changeButtonText()">Learn more about the Netherlands</button>
      <div id="myDIV" hidden> Going to the Netherlands was an amazing experience. This Ferbruary, I went to the Netherlands with my foreign exchange program at my school. My friends and I got to experience the Dutch life and culture. We got to go to our host students school as well as bike around different cities. As for landmarks, I went to the Anne Frank House, the Rememberance Museum, the Van Gogh Museum, as well as the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. I would totally recommend going to the Netherlands if you are ever going to Europe in the future.</div>
