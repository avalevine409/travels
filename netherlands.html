    <h1>The Netherlands</h1>

  <p> This February, I went to the Netherlands with my school.
    This trip was due to my acceptance into my schools exchange program the June before.
    Something really cool about the program that I got into is that everyone has to host an exchange student before we go there.
    In September, I hosted a Dutch boy named Rene for 6 days. I really didn't get to know him that well because of time.
    When we went to his country, I had the time of my life. Rene hosted another girl from my school named Katherine.
    During the time we were there; we watched Netflix, played Mario Party, listened to Post Malone when we were sad and went ice skating!

    During my time in the Netherlands, my school and I went to a lot of attractions around the countries.
    Some of the coolest places I've been to had to be in Amsterdam.
    One of the places I really enjoyed was the Van Gogh Museum.
    A lot of my friends and I before we went were extremely excited because on Instagram we saw photos of sunflowers surrounding the place.
    When we got to the Museum, we were a little dissapointed that there were no flowers and Van Goghs "Sunflower" painting was not there.
    The museum had paintings that spanned through the artists' several phases. Another place that I was stunned by was the Anne Frank House.
    This was the first year that my school got tickets for since 2017. I would show you all what was inside but there was a strict 'no pictures' policy inside.
    This museum/house had a deeper meaning as it showed me, a teenage Jewish girl in 2019, what it would be like to hide from Nazis in the 40s. This museum made me cry a lot.  </p>
